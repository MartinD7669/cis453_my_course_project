CIS453 - Unit 5 Final Course Project Submission

Application Summary: 

This application is focused on providing a site where users
can shop for watches online without ever having to leave their home.
The user can sort the porducts by men, women, or all watches. The coloring
and font style aid the site by adding a high-end look to it. Further 
embelishment of the site would include a functional "Cart" page with the 
ability to add or remove items from your cart.
